## Introduction

The development of programs that attempt to imitate the human brain is nothing recent. AI's have been a dream of a meany researcher for many years. While it already had a significant presence in science fiction literature, it's real world counterpart only recently garnered a broad attention in news media and the public. This project aims to track that change in awareness by initially observing the frequency of mentions of AI related keywords (specifically surrounding ChatGPT and OpenAI). In a second step a simple analysis of sentiment of the scraped articles is to be made. For this purpose we access the Guardian API and the considerable archieve of published articles.
